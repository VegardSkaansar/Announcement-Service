### Project description
We innitially set out to make an application we'd conceptualized in a previous course Systemdevelopment.
It was called Noahs Archive, and was essentially a service for pet owners/sellers, that was to act like an online marketplace.
Users would've been able to browse all advertizements for pets, currently registers or create ads of their own, if they so wished.
Ads would include information such as the contact info of the seller, their location, information on the animal and etc.

We strayed away from the animal theme and decided just building the core functionality of making an account, and being able to create and browse ads.

### What went well/wrong
TBD

### Hardest aspects of the project

### What new has the group learned
We would say this project has taught us first hand how the server side code, interacts with the local, client side html.
How pages are loaded up, and passing of information from the database over to the screen to be shown to the user.


### Total work hours.
